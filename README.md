# zigraylib
A fairly minimal [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) [zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) example codebase using the zig package manager.

This example requires one of the recent development releases of zig.

## install

git clone https://github.com/SimonLSchlee/zigraylib.git
cd zigraylib
zig build run
```

tested with zig version: `0.12.0-dev.2618+39ec3d311`

## ideas or improvements?
Let me know if you have ideas about things that could make this example better.
I want to keep it fairly minimal, but maybe we can add some more links to useful resources, or point out common problems.
